Title: 
The association between the social distance index with the incidence rate of COVID-19.

Brief description: 
I am trying to find the association between the social distance index with the incidence rate of COVID-19. To check whether keeping social distance is an effective way to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

To check all the data sets and details of the social distance index's calculation, please see the websites in "Methods" part. 

There are 10 steps to solve this question: 
Firstly, I read in the data. 
Then I check the data and delete the extra columns, make sure the two data sets match the same time period, which is from Jan/21/2020 to Sep/28/2020. 
Step 4 is to get the kable format table contains the mean information of the first 6 states: "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado". We can see the range of social distance doesn't fluctuate much in these states.
Step 5 is to check the missing values in both data sets.

Step 6 ~ Step 9 include 4 graphs: 
- The barchart of total US confirmed cases on Sep/28/2020.
- The barchart of states have the total confirmed cases on Sep/28/2020 which are over 200,000.
- The biaxial chart to compare the social distance index with the total confirmed cases in the states which are over 200,000.
- The map of the mean values of social distance index of the 9 states.
Step 10 using the cor.test to check the correlation coefficient and the p-value.
